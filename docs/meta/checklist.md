# Checklist

## Thinking about solution

- Immediately play with the sample cases, you may have understood the problem wrong
- Pay close attention to the constraints
- _Always_ consider doing Binary Search on the answer

## Before Submitting

- Even if the test cases pass, make sure your code is at least doing _something_
- If the test cases are _too_ simple, come up with a couple extra ones
- Check if constants are big enough
- Check time and memory limits
- Submit the right file

## General

- `#define int long long`
- Fast IO
- Be _very_ careful when copy pasting, check you've changed everything that needs changing
- Be wary of special cases, and when you do define one, be very sure you've correctly identified the full extent of their implications

## STL

- Don't call .back(), .front(), .top() on empty containers
- Don't change a container as you iterate through it (Even accessing a map may change it)
- Always make sure your iterators are valid

## Graphs

- Add edges both ways if the graph is bidirectional

## Beecrowd/UVa ðŸ¤®

- Don't put space at the end of output
- Check if there are multiple testcases
